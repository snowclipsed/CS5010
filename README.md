JAVA LISTS
List is used to provide an ordered collection of elements. The elements given in the lists are indexed.Using the concept of index, we can use various methods to insert, delete, update and search the elements. 
It is an interface that is inherited from the Collection interface, and is found in java.util package. Using ListIterator interface, we can traverse the list in forward or a backward manner (Bidirectional Traversal).

JAVA LINKED LISTS
The elements are stored in a double linked list using the Java LinkedList class. A linked-list data structure is offered. It implements the List and Deque interfaces and derives from the AbstractList class.

**Side note: Difference between linked list and double linked list (Just for understanding)
Linked list: In linked list, a node is divided into two parts: A data part that contains the value and a link connecting it to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: In Doubly Linked List, a node is divided into three parts: A data part that contains the value, a link connecting it to the next node, and a third link connecting it to the previous node.

JAVA ARRAYLISTS
The java.util package contains the ArrayList class, a resizable array. A built-in array in Java differs from an ArrayList in that an array's size cannot be changed.
Important features of Java's linked list:
1) Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
2) The LinkedList class in Java lacks synchronization.
3) The Java LinkedList class preserves the order of insertion.
4) A list, stack, or queue can all be utilized with the Java LinkedList class.
5) Since there is no need for shifting, manipulation in the Java LinkedList class is quick.

PACKAGES
Operation input and output are handled by the java.io package. Different classes in Java IO manage input and output sources. 
The Java.io.util package includes the collections framework and several utility classes. They are used for Lists, ArrayLists and Linked Lists.
